# AoC2022
Advent of Code 2022

Let's see how far we can get using ChatGPT, Copilot, and CodeSpaces. Gotta have internet to make internet.

First thing I had to do was set up Deno in Codespaces, I found out that you can customze the container that CodeSpaces runs in. https://deno.land/manual@v1.28.3/getting_started/setup_your_environment#github-codespaces . You have to click "Codespaces" in the bottom left-hand corner, where there's a little logo of two arrows pointing above each other. Once you click that, you'll see "Add Dev Container Configuration Files". You can also use `cmd+shift+p` and search "Add Dev Container Configuration Files".
